Content for the public website

# Template Files

Content resides in template files that are commonly named `<some_name>.html.ep`. 
In these files, common HTML tags and BS4 classes can be used, as well as 
special Mojolicious helpers and Perl code injection. However, the latter 
should be reserved for administrators.
